# Project Proposal



## MVP and Data Used

To answer this question I plan on using this data set of 50,000 games played in the 2020 season of League of Legends available on ![Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/benfattori/league-of-legends-diamond-games-first-15-minutes) that includes data such as the total gold per team, the average experience per team, how many of which objective they captured, as well as other features that will be important for determining the target of which team won.
The **MVP** for this project would look like a bar chart examining the highest average stats for winning teams in order of importance, with the eventual final goal being to build a logistic regression module to predict said winners.
