# Predicting League of Legends Wins

The goal of this project was to predict whether a team would win a game of League of Legends based on data from the first 15 minutes of the game. The data was retrieved from Kaggle and covered 50,000 games from the Diamond ranked league, having features such as each team's gold total, total kills, number of enemy towers destroyed, and average player level. I explored multiple classification models including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest models. This goal was achieved through logistic regression, having built a model with an F1 score of 0.80068 and an accuracy of 0.79560.
